#a class that will help us define what quantities pulled from the tree mean what
#and how to compute the various category relevant quantities.
#We'll split the quantities computed up into two basic tiers.
#One: The basic quantities. Quantities that (while they may change in uncertainites) are not reliant on other quantiites
#Two: the constructed quantities. Quantities dependent on the possibly shifting basic quantities

#We'll need two functions defined in a user configuration to properly fill both dictionaries
#they must overwrite the basic functions, which if called will just error out.
#"FillBasicQuantities" and "FillConstructedQuantities"
#FillConstructedQuantities will take the basic quantities as an argument.
